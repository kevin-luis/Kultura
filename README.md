# Kultura

Welcome to our project, Kultura.

We would like to explain a little bit about our project. According to data from the Directorate General of Culture of the Republic of Indonesia,  
from 2013 to 2022 there are 1728 intangible cultures divided into 5 domains. One of them is the Traditional Skills and Crafts domain,  
which recorded 440 cultural heritages, where one of the examples is the Balinese mask craft.  
In the era of globalisation, which has a great influence on our national culture.  
Who else if not us, the next generation of the nation who must maintain the existence of our culture?  
Machine learning-based Android application using image recognition to scan Balinese masks.  
This application is also expected to be an educational material for local and foreign tourists about Balinese masks.
